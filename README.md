# Loan Payment Prediction
This project will help in identifying the probability of repayment of loan by a customer on the basis of a number of factors such as the principal amount, terms, age and whether or not the customer has a high school degree and a college degree. In this project, I have made 3 separate models and compared their respective accuracies.
